# HLA-LA
Workflow for running HLA-LA on UK Biobank Research Analysis Platform and All of Us Research Workbench for HLA allele typing using whole genome sequencing data. 

# Background
HLA-LA is a graph-based method for accurate HLA typing from whole-genome sequencing (WGS), whole-exome sequencing (WES), and long-read sequencing data. It implements a projection-based graph alignment approach that achieves high accuracy across different data types:

99% accuracy on whole-genome Illumina data

93% accuracy on whole-exome Illumina data

98% accuracy on long-read Oxford Nanopore and Pacific Biosciences data
